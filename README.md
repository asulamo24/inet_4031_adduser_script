Program Description
This script is designed to streamline the process of adding multiple users to a Linux system, making it an efficient solution for system administrators. It reads user details from a structured input file, automates the creation of user accounts, and assigns the appropriate groups and passwords. By automating these repetitive tasks, the script reduces errors and saves time, particularly in environments where numerous user accounts need to be managed or set up in bulk.

Program Operation
Prepare an input file containing user details, with each line formatted as username:password:last name:first name:group1,group2. This structured format ensures that all necessary information, such as usernames, passwords, and group assignments, is available for the script to process.
Execute the script using the following command, ensuring you have administrative privileges:
bash
Copy code
sudo python3 create-users.py < create-users.input
The script reads the input file, creates user accounts, sets secure passwords, and assigns users to their respective groups. If any of the groups specified do not exist, the script can handle group creation or alert the administrator. This ensures seamless integration of user management within the system.
